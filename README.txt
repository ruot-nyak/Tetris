Tetris: by Ruot Nyak
I am going to be creating the game tetris for my first intensive. Tetris can be complex
because we have blocks falling from the top and freezing at the lowest point. Then if a row is filled
the row clears. That being said it's not extremely difficult and I think is a could first intensive.
